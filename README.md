# Nomster

#### Ruby on Rails framework. 

Nomster is a Yelp clone app that lets users make a profile, post restaurants, and comment on other restaurants. You can check it out [here](https://nomster-pam-willenz.herokuapp.com/). Sign up, add some of your favorite gluten-free, italian restaurants, and discover new ones too!

### Features:
* Google Maps API is integrated to let users see where their restaurant while checking out a restaurant.

* Twitter Bootstrap 3 was utilized for CSS and components.

* Devise is used for user security and forms.

* Homepage slider that uses carousel to switch between photos.

* Users can comment on other restaurant pages.

* Amazon Web Services (S3) is used for photo storage when users upload photos of their restaurants.

* Profile page shows which restaurants the user has created, which restaurants the user has commented on, and other stats.
